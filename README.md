# Data-Structures-Programs
These are some of the Data Structure Programs I have learned to date in C programming.

<br>This repository contains 10 programs: -
<br>
1.Stacks Operation<br>
This C program uses an array to implement a simple stack with a fixed size of 5. It includes functions to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from it, and display its contents. The main() function provides a menu-driven interface for performing these operations.
<br>
<br>
2. Infix to Postfix Conversion using Stacks
<br>
This C program converts an infix expression to postfix notation using the Shunting Yard algorithm. It includes functions to handle operator precedence and stack operations. The infix_postfix function processes the input infix expression, utilizing a stack to manage operators and ensure correct precedence in the resulting postfix expression.
<br>
<br>
3. Evaluation of Suffix expression
<br>
This C program evaluates a postfix (reverse Polish notation) expression. It uses a stack to store operands and performs arithmetic operations based on the postfix notation. The eval function processes expressions, handling operators like +, -, *, /, %, and ^. The result is displayed after computation.
<br>
<br>
4. double Ended Queue
This C program implements a double-ended queue (deque) using a fixed-size array. It supports insertion at both front and rear (functions IF and IR), deletion from both front and rear (functions DF and DR), and displays the contents of the queue (Display). The program offers a menu-driven interface for these operations.
<br>
<br>

5. Circular Queue
 <br>
This C program implements a circular queue using an array. It provides functions to insert elements (ir), delete elements from the front (df), and display the queue's contents. The queue operates in a circular manner, utilizing a fixed size of 5, with operations managed through front (f) and rear (r) pointers.

<br>
6. Singly Linked List Operation on Student Data
<br>
This C program implements a linked list to manage student records, including USN, name, branch, semester, and phone number. It allows insertion at the front (IF) and rear (IR), deletion from the front (DF) and rear (DR), and displays the list's contents (disp). The user interacts via a menu-driven interface.
<br>
<br>
7. doubly Linked List on Employee Data
<br>
This C program manages a doubly linked list of employee records, including SSN, name, department, designation, salary, and phone number. It allows insertion at the front (IF) and rear (IR), deletion from the front (DF) and rear (DR), and displays the list's contents (disp). The user interacts via a menu-driven interface.
