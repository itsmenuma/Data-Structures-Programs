1.Stacks Operation
<br>
This C program implements a simple stack with a fixed size of 5, using an array. It includes functions to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from the stack, and display the stack's contents. The main() function provides a menu-driven interface for performing these operations.

2.Infix to Postfix Coversion using Stacks
<br>
This C program converts an infix expression to postfix notation using the Shunting Yard algorithm. It includes functions to handle operator precedence and stack operations. The infix_postfix function processes the input infix expression, utilizing a stack to manage operators and ensuring correct precedence in the resulting postfix expression.
