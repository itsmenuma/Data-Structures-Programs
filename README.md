# Data-Structures-Programs
These are some of the Data Structure Programs I have learned to date in C programming.

<br>
1. Stacks Operation
<br>
This C program uses an array to implement a simple stack with a fixed size of 5. It includes functions to push elements onto the stack, pop elements from it, and display its contents. The main() function provides a menu-driven interface for performing these operations.
<br>
<br>
2. Infix to Postfix Conversion using Stacks
<br>
This C program converts an infix expression to postfix notation using the Shunting Yard algorithm. It includes functions to handle operator precedence and stack operations. The infix_postfix function processes the input infix expression, utilizing a stack to manage operators and ensure correct precedence in the resulting postfix expression.
<br>
<br>
3. Evaluation of Suffix expression
4. <br>
This C program evaluates a postfix (reverse Polish notation) expression. It uses a stack to store operands and performs arithmetic operations based on the postfix notation. The eval function processes expressions, handling operators like +, -, *, /, %, and ^. The result is displayed after computation.
